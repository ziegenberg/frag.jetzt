<h1>To all teachers who are interested in a timely digital feedback of their students:</h1>

<div>The classical lecture usually ends with: »Do you have any questions?« And always nobody answers or the same few
  ask. Either nobody dares to ask questions in the large lecture hall or the questions one actually wanted to ask in the
  course of the lecture are forgotten. Those who want their lecture content to be reflected upon and questioned need a
  tool for anonymously asking questions. Such an Open Source tool is available free of charge with »frag.jetzt«. Are
  there any concerns? Is the tool accessible, compliant with the data protection regulations, immediately usable with
  any end device without any training or technical understanding? Three times yes.
  If I let »frag.jetzt« be used anonymously and thus without social control, don't I also invite abuse? No, because the
  question list can be moderated live by an assistant: Only lecture-appropriate questions remain in the question list.
  But I cannot answer all questions in the last ten minutes of my lecture. Sure. This is where the collective tool
  aspect comes into play: Everyone in the audience can rate every question, in other words: to vote up or down. You can
  answer the questions most highly rated by the auditorium immediately, the others, if you wish, later in the course
  forum of the learning platform.
